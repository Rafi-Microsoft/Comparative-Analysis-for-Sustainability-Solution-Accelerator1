# Test Solution Accelerator 

You can use one of the two methods described below to test the solution accelerator. Please review the user story, top features on main page [README.md](../README.md) and [ArchitectureDescription.md](../Deployment/docs/ArchitectureDescription.md)  to get familiar with the features provided by this solution accelerator, and use the information to develop your test cases. 

#### Method 1: Use data supplied by the solution accelerator 

You can test with sample Microsoft Sustainability Report supplied by the solution accelerator, and download sustainability reports from Microsoft peers, using the the links provided below. 

 In `Deployment/data` folder, you can find [Microsoft 2024 Environment Sustainability Report](./data/Microsoft_2024_Environmental_Sustainability_Report.pdf). To produce benchmark reports, you can download sustainability reports published by Microsoft Peers, for example: 

| Peer Sustainability Reports              | Format | Document Link                                                |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Apple Environmental Progress Report 2024 | .pdf   | [2024 Environmental Progress Report (apple.com)](https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/Apple_Environmental_Progress_Report_2024.pdf) |
| Amazon Sustainability Report 2023        | .pdf   | [2023-sustainability-report.pdf (aboutamazon.com)](https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/2023-sustainability-report.pdf) |
| Google Environmental Report 2024         | .pdf   | [Google 2024 Environmental Report - Google Sustainability (gstatic.com)](https://www.gstatic.com/gumdrop/sustainability/google-2024-environmental-report.pdf) |

#### Method 2: Use Your Own Sustainability Report Data

You can test with your own company's sustainability report and the sustainability reports from your own industry peers, following the mechanisms described in **Method 1**. 

You will need to replace  [Microsoft 2024 Environment Sustainability Report](./data/Microsoft_2024_Environmental_Sustainability_Report.pdf) with your own sustainability report. You will need to obtain sustainability reports from your industry peers. You can download publicly available sustainability reports from their websites. If the reports are not in `.pdf` format, you will need to convert them into `.pdf` files in order to use the solution accelerator.
