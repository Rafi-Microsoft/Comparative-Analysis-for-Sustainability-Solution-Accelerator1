# Comparative Analysis for Sustainability

This solution accelerator enables you to advance your sustainability initiatives with precision by using AI to compare your reports to peers, benchmark them against industry standards, and quickly create a plan of action. you can compare your business to peers using Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive ([CSRD](https://finance.ec.europa.eu/capital-markets-union-and-financial-markets/company-reporting-and-auditing/company-reporting/corporate-sustainability-reporting_en)) and Global Reporting Initiatives ([GRI](https://www.globalreporting.org/standards)).

Solution overview
</h2>
This solution accelerator enables companies to detect compliance gaps, benchmark against their peers, and generate action plans to ensure they‚Äôre on track to meet their sustainability goals. Leveraging the simplicity of PowerApps, users can easily upload documents and generate gap analyses and benchmarking reports for GRI and CSRD indicators. An AI-generated report is then created, which provides a brief summary of the company‚Äôs (and their peer‚Äôs) performance, similarities/dissimilarities, and an action plan for improvement. The user can also use natural language with a Teams Copilot to ask questions about the reports to further aid understanding and actionability.

Please review the [**Release Notes Page**]( ./Deployment/docs/ReleaseNotes.md) to see what is new.

{üü®TODO: Call out specific pricing "gotchas" like Azure Container Registry if known}

Pricing varies per region and usage, so it isn't possible to predict exact costs for your usage. The majority of the Azure resources used in this infrastructure are on usage-based pricing tiers. However, Azure Container Registry has a fixed cost per registry per day.

{üü®TODO: Update with solution specific estimate sheet}

Use the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator) to calculate the cost of this solution in your subscription. 

Review a [sample pricing sheet](https://azure.com/e/68b51f4cb79a4466b631a11aa57e9c16) in the event you want to customize and scale usage.

_Note: This is not meant to outline all costs as selected SKUs, scaled use, customizations, and integrations into your own tenant can affect the total consumption of this sample solution. The sample pricing sheet is meant to give you a starting point to customize the estimate for your specific needs._
